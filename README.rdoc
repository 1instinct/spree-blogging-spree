= BloggingSpree

Originally forked from paulcc/spree-blog, this extension intends to offer a more complete blogging solution for use within the Spree E-Commerce application.

Development is in its early stages, containing only a simple blog and a jQuery-powered news archive widget. See the current TODO list below.


== Installation

    script/extension install git://github.com/jaymendoza/spree-blogging-spree.git
    rake db:migrate


== Compatibility Issues

Tagging functionality is currently broken for sqlite-driven sites.


== Dependencies

* Spree 0.9.3*
* is_taggable
* jQuery
* nicEdit <i>(included)</i>

<i>*may run on edge Spree with some modification</i>


== Testing

* RSpec
* factory_girl
* spork

The included spec_helper.rb is configured for use with Spork due to Spree's extended loading time.
